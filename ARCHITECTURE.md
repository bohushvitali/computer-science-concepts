## Why is a clean, simple, flexible, evolvable, and agile architecture important?

Software architecture is the high level structure of a software system, the
discipline of creating such structures, and the documentation of these
structures

It is the set of structures needed to reason about the software system, and
comprises the software elements, the relations between them, and the
properties of both elements and relations

In todayâ€™s software development world, requirements change,
environments change, team members change, technologies change, and so
should the architecture of our systems.

The architecture defines the parts of a system that are hard and costly to
change. Therefore we are in need of a clean, simple, flexible, evolvable, and
agile architecture to be able to keep up with all the changes surrounding us.
