 - Design Patterns
  - Creational Patterns
    - Abstract Factory
      - Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
    - Builder
      - Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
    - Factory Method
      - Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
    - Prototype
      - Specify the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
    - Singleton
      - Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
  - Structural Patterns
    - Adapter
      - Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
    - Bridge
       - Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
    - Composite
      - Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
    - Decorator
       - Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
    - Facade
      - Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
    - Flyweight
      - Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
    - Proxy
      - Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
  - Behavioral Patterns
    - Chain of Resp.
      - Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
    - Command
      - Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
    - Interpreter
      - Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.
    - Iterator
      - Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
    - Mediator
      - Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.
    - Memento
      - Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
    - Observer
      - Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
    - State
      - Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
    - Strategy
      - Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
    - Template Method
      - Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
    - Visitor
      - Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
- Functional Programming
  - Arity
    - The number of arguments a function takes.
    - From words like unary, binary, ternary, etc.
  - Higher-Order Functions (HOF)
    - A function which takes a function as an argument and/or returns a function.
  - Closure
    - A closure is a scope which retains variables available to a function when it's created. 
    - This is important for partial application to work.
  - Partial Application
    - Partially applying a function means creating a new function by pre-filling some of the arguments to the original function.
    - Partial application helps create simpler functions from more complex ones by baking in data when you have it.
    - Curried functions are automatically partially applied.
  - Currying
    - The process of converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a function that takes them one at a time.
